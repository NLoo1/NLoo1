Hi, I'm Nicholas (@nloo1)! Currently I'm using GitHub as a repository for personal projects. Right now, I wanted to challenge myself by redoing some old assignments from Stony Brook University's Data Structures course. 
I'm looking to get into software development and/or engineering, practicing via LeetCode on the side and considering a course at Codecademy.

I originally had planned to major in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, but unfortunately had to switch majors as I found the courses too difficult at the time. As of now, I'm spending most of my time self-learning wherever possible instead!
