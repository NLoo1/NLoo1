# Hi! Iâ€™m Nick ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer passionate about building efficient, user-friendly applications. I recently completed a **9-month, self-paced bootcamp** and enjoy collaborating on innovative projects while solving complex problems through code.

- Yes, a lot of my repos don't have a README at this time
